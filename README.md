# ConnectFour
A simple connect four game I programmed for a friend as his computer science project in highschool.  

The program is fully functional and is exactly what you would expect. The only thing I didn't bother to do is displaying a winning message inside the JFrame. The winner is depicted in the console and the game instantly restarts.

### A repository for learning
I think the program is great for learning Java and coding in general. Even my friend understood it (except for the `checkWinner()` function) eventhough he is not at all comfortable with programming. I tried to make the code as simple and intuitively as possible.
